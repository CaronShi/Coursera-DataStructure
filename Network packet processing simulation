# Network Packet Processing Simulation
 i = i th packet
 Ai = Arriving time of packet i
 Pi = Processing time of packet i
 S = the size of buffer(define by yourself, if packet's number>s, will drop the packet)

#input
1st line: S(size of buffer), n(the total number of packets)
ith line: Ai, Pi

#output
i-1 lines: Time of processor begin processing this packet/ -1 if dropped

#
create a list(finsh time of the previous one is the begining time of this one)
- Ai
1. must be ascending or equal(0,0,1,1,2,3,4)
2. if equal, should consider about the buffer size
  if remaining size >= number of same Ai: ok
  else: next(number of same Ai - remaining size) will be dropped, remainding size of same is ok
        next n numbers will append -1
- Pi
1. finish_time = []
2. finsh_time.append (finish_time[-1](the last one)+=Pi)
3. -1 if be dropped
